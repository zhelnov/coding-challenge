# Welcome to Welds coding-challenge

## Introduction
Here at Weld we use [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) for our applications. So this project also reflects that. On our front-end we use NextJS and GraphQL. For simplicity we have used the monorepo structure from NestJS.

## Challenge
One of our customers wants us to help them build a pipeline for Hubspot. And they want us to setup a new data-pipeline for them to get information out and into their current data-warehouse.

To accomplish this you will build two services:
- **Data-streams**: Our API that can receive calls and issue commands to **worker**. This service also stores any information that our customer wants to fetch.
- **Worker:** Fetches the data from Hubspot. Makes any transformations you see fit. And sends it back to **data-streams** for storage.

### Steps in challenge
- Configure a message protocol between the two services. You can get inspiration from the [nestjs docs.](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/basics) Choose which ever you want but tell us why in your answer.
- Create an endpoint on **data-streams** that tells **worker** to start fetching data on an interval (every 5 minutes).
- Setup an [http module](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/http-module) that **worker** can use to communicate with Hubspot.
- Send the data and store the results on **data-streams** using internal communication protocol.
- Make an endpoint on **data-streams** that can fetch the data stored on **data-streams**. Use whatever storage you see fit but tell us why you chose it.
- Make an endpoint on **data-streams** that can stop the data fetching on **worker**.

## How we evaluate
- A documented answer that explains your approach, short-comings, how-to-run and future work.
- A working solution. Preferably with some tests to give us an idea of how you write tests (you don't need to put it all under test).
- Reliability is very important when dealing with data-pipelines. So any measures you can add to keep the data-flowing will be appreciated.
- We understand that this can be time consuming. If you are short on time leave something out. But be sure to tell us your approach to the problem in the documentation.
- We appreciate small commits with a trail of messages that shows us how you work.

## Project structure

├── apps
│   ├── data-streams

```
### data-streams:
This is our API. We will be able to issue HTTP requests to this and have it talk to our microservice **worker**.
We also store any information that **worker** sends our way. This project has been setup as a hybrid app. It can both function as an API but also as a microservice with an internal communication layer.

You can start data-streams with:
```
yarn start
```

### worker:
This is the worker microservice that is in charge of talking to the external API. It will fetch data when issued a command from **data-streams** and then return the results. This project only functions as a microservice which means it can only receive commands from the internal communication layer.

You can start worker with:
```
yarn start worker
```
